## Technique Sessions

### SCAMPER Method (20 minutes)
**S - Substitute:** WhatsApp alternatives (Discord, Telegram, Slack), Selenium for FFB integration, keyword-based vs AI classification
**C - Combine:** Automatic pair formation + registration + notifications, tournament templates with bulk creation, real-time status updates
**A - Adapt:** Dating app matching + corporate booking availability systems, efficiency solutions beyond WhatsApp's social limitations
**M - Modify:** Bidding system compatibility matching, post-tournament surveys for player compatibility scores, voice input + template wizards, user notification preferences
**P - Put to other uses:** Focused on bridge-specific scope, potential for other FFB-managed card games
**E - Eliminate:** Manual tournament creation, redundant confirmations, spam-like verbose notifications, data re-entry of recurring tournament parameters
**R - Reverse:** Proactive match suggestions vs player requests, auto-generated tournaments from demand patterns, personalized tournament feeds vs broadcast messages

### What If Scenarios (15 minutes)
**Unlimited Resources:** Bridge intelligence platform with convention card auto-generation, bidding system discussions memory, AI practice hands, optimal play challenges
**Perfect FFB API:** Website navigation automation sufficient for current needs, main impact on organizer workflows
**90% Organizer Workload Reduction:** Eliminate daily WhatsApp partner-matching grind, automate tournament creation from templates

### Assumption Reversal (15 minutes)
**Proactive partner suggestions:** System initiates matching before requests (valuable bonus feature)
**Tournament auto-creation:** Rejected - organizers must maintain control, but can be assisted
**Individual vs group communication:** Personalized channels for partner/team matching preferred over group broadcasts
**Explicit registration:** Non-negotiable - maintains accountability and organizer control

### Analogical Thinking (10 minutes)
**Stock Trading:** Auto-pairing one hour before tournament start (allows cancellation window), optimal pairing for multiple waiting players
**Restaurant Reservations:** Dynamic availability calendars, intelligent waitlist management with notifications
**Dating Apps:** Optional post-game feedback for new pairs/teams, availability calendar integration
**Cross-domain insights:** Time-bounded auto-pairing creates urgency while maintaining flexibility
